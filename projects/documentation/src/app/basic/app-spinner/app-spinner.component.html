      A spinner control is a type of UI element that is used to indicate that a background process is ongoing.
      It is often used to provide feedback to the user when an application is performing a task that requires time,
      such as loading data, processing a request, or saving a file. The spinner control typically appears as a rotating
      animation that is displayed in the center of the screen or in a specific area of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spinner control serves two main purposes: first, it informs the user that something is happening and
      that they should wait, and second, it prevents the user from interacting with the application until the task
      is completed. This helps to ensure that the application remains responsive and stable, and that the user
      experience is smooth and seamless.
