    <p>
      An expandable list UI component is a user interface element that allows users to view and interact with a list of
      items, with the ability to expand or collapse individual items to show or hide additional content associated with each item.
    </p>

    <p>
      An expandable list typically consists of a series of items, each of which can be expanded to reveal additional
      details or options. When an item is expanded, the additional content associated with that item is displayed beneath
      the item in the list. When an item is collapsed, the additional content is hidden, and only the item's summary
      information is displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The expandable list UI component can be used in a variety of contexts, such as a navigation menu, a list of
      items in an e-commerce site, or a list of tasks in a productivity app. By allowing users to expand and collapse
      individual items, the component provides a way to display a lot of information in a compact space, while still
      providing users with the ability to view details when needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, expandable lists are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear indicators of which items
      are expandable and which are not. In some cases, the component may also provide additional functionality, such
      as the ability to reorder items or perform actions on individual items.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, an expandable list UI component is a versatile and useful tool for displaying complex information in a
      way that is easy for users to navigate and understand.
