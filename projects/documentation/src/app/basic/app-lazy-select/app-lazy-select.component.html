    <p>
      A "lazy select box" is likely a type of select dropdown control that loads its options only when they are needed,
      instead of loading all the options at once. The purpose of this is to improve the performance of the control,
      especially when the select box has a large number of options.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a lazy select box, the options are usually loaded as the user scrolls through the list or starts typing
      into the select box, and new options are loaded dynamically as needed. This allows the select box to start
      up quickly and avoid long loading times, and also reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred from
      the server to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of select box is often used in web applications where a large number of options are available and
      the user may not need to see all the options at once. By loading options lazily, the select box can provide
      a better user experience and improve the performance of the web application.

    <p>
      A "lazy multi-select" refers to a type of user interface control, or widget, in which a user can select
      multiple items from a list, but the list is only loaded as needed (i.e., "lazily"). This is often used in
      situations where the list of items is very large, and loading all items at once could negatively impact the
      performance of the user interface. Instead, items are loaded on demand, as the user scrolls through the list,
      or as they search for specific items.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this type of control, items that have not yet been loaded may be represented as placeholders, with the actual
      item content loaded as the user interacts with the control. This can help to improve the overall user experience
      by reducing the amount of time it takes to load the list, and can help to conserve system resources such as memory
      and processing power
