      A progress bar is a type of UI control that is used to indicate the completion status of a task, such as a
      file download or an upload. It typically consists of a bar that fills up as the task progresses, with the
      length of the bar representing the completion percentage of the task.

      A progress bar can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and Typescript. To create a progress bar, you first need
      to define a container element, such as a div, and set its width and height. Then, you can add a child element,
      such as a span, that represents the actual progress bar. You can style the child element using CSS to give it
      a specific look and feel.

      In order to update the progress bar in real-time as the task progresses, you can use Typescript to manipulate
      the width of the child element. You can calculate the completion percentage based on the progress of the task,
      and use that information to dynamically set the width of the child element.

      There are also many libraries and frameworks that provide pre-built components for creating progress bars,
      which can save time and simplify the development process. Additionally, some libraries may provide additional
      features, such as animations, custom styles, and event handling.
