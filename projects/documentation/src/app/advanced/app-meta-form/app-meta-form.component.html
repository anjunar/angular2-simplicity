    <p>
      A JSON schema based form is a type of web form that is generated based on a JSON schema. A JSON schema is a JSON
      document that describes the structure and constraints of the data that is expected to be entered into the form.
      The form is generated dynamically based on the JSON schema, which allows for greater flexibility and easier
      maintenance of the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JSON schema defines the fields that are to be included in the form, as well as any constraints or validation
      rules that need to be applied to the data entered into the form. This means that changes to the form can be made
      by simply modifying the JSON schema, without having to change the actual code for the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of JSON schemas for generating forms can simplify the development process and help ensure that the form
      is consistent and correctly structured. It can also make it easier to integrate the form with other systems,
      such as databases or APIs, as the structure of the data entered into the form is explicitly defined in the JSON schema.
